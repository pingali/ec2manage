These are the goals of the setup: 

 1. launch database instance

     allow setting as a master or a slave 

 2. restore from S3 backup and configure as master
  
     deploy a master and restore the db? 

 3. configure as slave, using DB transfer from master for initial state
     
     how to do db transfer? copy the entire volume? 

 4. promote slave to master

     configuration file changes and restart? 

 5. backup to S3
  
     this has to be enabled on the slave role?
