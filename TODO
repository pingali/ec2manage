#Overall design 
1. Think through the design
http://jineshvaria.s3.amazonaws.com/public/cloudarchitectures-varia.pdf

# Application
1. Check why http://admin is redirected to http://admin...
2. Check if rsync -uav preserves timestamps during initialization
   of the host
3. Commandline arg based switch to handle runtime mode of deployment
   and local its correcponding configurations

#EC2 
1. Add capistrano command to deploy an instance from the command
line
2. Use a separate key name for each instance and use the key to 
indicate the type of the machine
3. Dynamically discover the machines in the network

4. Support for free Cloudkick and Tapin (non-free) monitoring service 
http://www.tapinsystems.com
https://www.cloudkick.com/
5. Add support for user-data during deployment 
6. Remove AWS credentials from the instance and provide them as user-data
that is decrypted on the fly using the private key uploaded to 
the machine
6. Bundling of an entire volume as a master or slave AMI
7. Test a bundled instance/snapshot/volume

#SMTP 
1. Get the mailing working 
use postfix configuration file 
AUTHSMTP account

# Apache
1. Bandwidth throtting - not a high priority right now 
http://www.howtoforge.com/mod_cband_apache2_bandwidth_quota_throttling

# MySQL 
1. Automatic configuration of the slave 
2. Support for striping/volume management - split the database across 
   multiple volumes. Instructions here: 
http://gist.github.com/86260
3. 

# Backups/EBS 
1. zrm backups are in /mnt/mysql-zrm/backup. They have to be
   copied to S3 and/or another volume. 
2. Restore needs to be completed and verified 
3. volumeid in /etc/ec2onrails/ec2_ebs.yml is empty -FIXED
4. Change the DB root password - ask for it during deployment
5. Hardcoded restore directory. Generalize the code. 
6. Automount EBS volume upon boot

# God 
1. god is putting out gobs of messages in /mnt/log/debug. Fix it! 
2. God is sending a restart message to the processes when it
   starts! Check this to write the scripts correctly 
   http://god.rubyforge.org/
   Wonder if it is ok.  - FIXED 

# Webserver 
1. Need to able to enable/disable through the capistrano script
2. myfavorite-app1.ssl and myfavorite-app2.ssl are conflicting! Fix the 
   /etc/apache2 configuration 

# Source code
1. Daily syncing of the code? 

# Splunk 
1. How to perform regular monitoring? 

# Status information
1. Command to get the running status of the server and the processes

# Log files 
1. Have to move them around. Where?
